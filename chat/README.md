# For Chat
All here is non-case-sensitive and only the default help message

- You can control movements by typing 'up', 'down', 'right' or 'left'
- You can do any action from the DS ('A', 'B', 'X' or 'Y')
- L is 'L'
- R is 'R'

For help message, it's 'help'

Although, your stream could have change the settings and not the help page which is unfortunate...
