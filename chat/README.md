All here is non-case-sensitive

You can control movements by typing 'up', 'down', 'right' or 'left'
You can do any action from the DS ('A', 'B', 'X' or 'Y')
L is 'l'
R is 'r'

help is 'help'

Although, your stream could have change the settings and not the help page which is unfortunate...
