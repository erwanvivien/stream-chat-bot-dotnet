# EMU twitch bot
## Introduction
This bot will read chat messages as input.
Will process them and do stuff on the host machine. 

The end goal is to run any _simple_ emulator (DS, nes, etc) by broadcasting keys to said emulator
A simple feature includes chaos / order (affects time between messages to let twitch chat take action)

## Current
The bot is for now in dev.
It should not be so hard to develop and should be a lot of fun

## Next steps:
- Run on youtube
- Run without any bugs
- Easy install & use for personnal projects
- Setup patreon
