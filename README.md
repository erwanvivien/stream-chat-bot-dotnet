# twitch-chat-bot-dotnet
This bot will read chat messages as input.
Will process them and do stuff on the host machine. 

The end goal is to run any _simple_ emulator (DS, nes, etc) by broadcasting keys to said emulator
A simple feature includes chaos / order (affects time between messages to let twitch chat take action)
